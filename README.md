# ðŸ“š book-a-week

A simple web app to help me stay on track with reading one book a week.

Try it for yourself on [https://maurogestoso.github.io/book-a-week/](https://maurogestoso.github.io/book-a-week/).

All data is stored on `localStorage`, no servers, works offline.

## TODO

- [ ] Make it a PWA
- [ ] Allow to edit start and end date
- [ ] Display list of finished books
- [ ] Display list of abandoned books
- [ ] Collect stats
- [ ] Import/export data
